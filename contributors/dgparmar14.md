🌟 Open Source Enthusiast & Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Contributor 2024 🌟

Hi! I'm Dhrumit Parmar, 

I am an enthusiastic open-source contributor and currently a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2024 contributor with OHC. I am excited to be working on LEaderboard, with a focus on  e.g., enhancing features, optimizing performance.

🌱 Passionate about open-source, I have actively contributed to various projects and communities. My journey in open-source has been driven by a desire to collaborate, learn, and make meaningful impacts.
