Hey there 👋 I'm a software engineer by trade, but chef and consumer of fiction (from books to games) and non-fiction if you go by my hobbies. 

Outside of software, I'm passionate about history and anthropology, particularly on how human societies have organized over time, and what we could do for the future - especially in our fight to curb the effects of climate change.
